# Custom Context Menu Component

This repository contains a React implementation of a custom context menu component. The context menu can be triggered by right-clicking anywhere on the page or clicking on specific elements. It includes a hook (`useContextMenu`) for managing the state and behavior of the context menu and a container component (`ContextMenuContainer`) that renders the menu.

## Features

- **Customizable**: The appearance and behavior of the context menu can be easily customized through props.
- **Responsive**: The context menu adapts to its content size while maintaining a consistent layout.
- **Accessible**: Designed with accessibility in mind, ensuring keyboard navigation and screen reader support.
